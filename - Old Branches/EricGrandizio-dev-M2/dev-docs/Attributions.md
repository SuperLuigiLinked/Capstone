This is the first ever full-project I've written using the Vulkan Graphics API.

In order to learn Vulkan, I read the tutorial at [vulkan-tutorial.com](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/), as well as snippets of the Vulkan specification.

The Vulkan Tutorial is written in C++, uses the Vulkan C-Bindings, the GLFW Windowing Library, and is focused on 3D Rendering.

My Project is written in Rust, uses the Ash Library (small Rust wrapper around Vulkan), my own Windowing Library (made in Milestone 1), and is focused on 2D Rendering.

Though I was following the Tutorial, I made it a point to write my own code.
In addition, the types of features I implemented diverge from those demonstrated in the Tutorial, and the Vulkan code had to be integrated into the rest of my project.

Nevertheless, given my limited experience with Vulkan, much of my Vulkan-rendering code follows the approaches outlined in the Tutorial.

This attribution is to give due credit to the Vulkan Tutorial.
